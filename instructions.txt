# Full Instructions for running stream

1) Ensure consistencies between /etc/ffserver.conf and ~/stargazer/ffrun.sh
   Stream parameters like frame rate must line up or the stream could crash. 

2) Run ~/ffrun.sh
   This first kills any processes on Port 8090.
   Then it launches FFserver on HttpPort 8090 using ffserver.conf as a guide
   It then spawns an FFmpeg process to decode and pass along the video from V4L drivers /dev/video0

3) Run ~/ffview.sh
   This just holds the proper command for viewing the stream using FFplay. It is mainly for consistence and conv   enience.
